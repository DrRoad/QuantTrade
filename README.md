About
=====

This is a tutorial and practice based on quantitative textbooks such as [Quantitative trading: How to Build Your Own Algorithmic Trading Business](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Trading-Build-Algorithmic-Business/dp/0470284889/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1515887204&sr=8-1&keywords=quantitative+trading) and [Automated Trading with R: Quantitative Research and Platform Development](https://www.amazon.com/Automated-Trading-Quantitative-Research-Development/dp/148422177X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1515887245&sr=1-1&keywords=automated+trading+with+r). My interest is in determining trading algorithm suitable for cryptocurrency while also learning how to use automated trading algorithms.
